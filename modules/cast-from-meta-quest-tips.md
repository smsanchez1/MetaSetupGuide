### **Tips**

* If casting doesn’t appear, verify all devices are on the **same Wi-Fi network and frequency band** (2.4GHz or 5GHz).
* Restart your **headset**, **Chromecast**, or **router** if the device list doesn’t update.
* For best performance, keep all devices close to the Wi-Fi router.
* You can also cast to the **Meta Quest Link app** on PC if it’s connected to the headset.
